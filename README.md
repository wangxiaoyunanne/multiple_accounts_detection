To run sample dataset 

1 Using Katz unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning with Katz

python katz_sim.py

2 Using semi-supervised learning with graph embbing 

python test_norm_2.py

3 Using clustering methods to improve scalability. Here I first tried kmeans then changed to spectral clustering

python test_kmeans.py
