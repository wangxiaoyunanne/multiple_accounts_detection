To run sample dataset

Quick start

1 Using Katz unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning with Katz

python katz_sim.py

You could explore the trade off between precision and recall by changing the "thres" in line 106. 

2 Using semi-supervised learning with graph embbing 

python test_norm_2.py

3 Using clustering methods to improve scalability. Here I first tried kmeans then changed to spectral clustering

python test_kmeans.py

You could change the num_group to see how the number of clusters effect on the performance in both speed and accuracy.
